## User Story

As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business.

## Technology Used

JavaScript
Node.jsÂ 
Inquirer
MySQL

## Installation

After cloning down the repository, you will want to open your terminal to run the program.

Then navigate the project directory, using the terminal you can run:

### `npm i`

to install all the Node modules. With your SQL server running, run db/schema.sql to create the proper database and tables. I have included a seeds.sql file to import some example data to manipulate for testing.

After that has completed, you may type:

#### `npm index.js`

to run the app in the terminal. Follow the prompts to add and manipulate your employee data.
